            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Rebeca hopes she is doing this right.</p>
            <p>She is majoring in Web Development at Dallas College and hopes to master coding despite still having no idea on how or where to start.</p>
            <p>Rebeca takes piano classes as well as martial arts classes and is currently working as an intern for an ecommerce business. 
                It gets pretty busy for her. But it's okay, she keeps pushing.</p>
